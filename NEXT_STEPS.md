# Next Steps for Contract Registration

## Summary

We've prepared everything needed to register your NFT contract on Dash Platform testnet:

1. **Contract Definition**: `contracts/nft3d-contract-final.json` ✅
2. **Identity ID**: `5DbLwAxGBzUzo81VewMUwn4b5P4bpv9FNFybi25XB5Bk` ✅
3. **Private Key**: Verified and stored in `.env` ✅
4. **Local Contract ID**: `AyWK6nDVfb8d1ZmkM5MmZZrThbUyWyso1aMeGuuVSfxf` ✅

## The Issue

The Dash JavaScript SDK requires identities to be created from within the wallet, not imported. Since your identity already exists on the platform, the SDK can't properly associate it with your private key for contract publishing.

## Recommended Solution

Use the Dash CLI tool:

```bash
# Run the prepared script
./register-with-cli.sh

# Or manually:
npm install -g @dashevo/dash-cli
dash contract create \
  --network testnet \
  --identity "5DbLwAxGBzUzo81VewMUwn4b5P4bpv9FNFybi25XB5Bk" \
  --private-key "XK6CFyvYUMvY9FVQLeYBZBFDbC4QuBLiqWMAFxBVZcMHJ5eARJtf" \
  --definition contracts/nft3d-contract-final.json
```

## After Registration

1. Copy the contract ID from the output
2. Update your `.env` file:
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_TESTNET_CONTRACT_ID=<contract-id-here>
   ```
3. Restart your Next.js development server
4. The NFT marketplace will now use your registered contract

## Alternative: Create New Identity

If the CLI doesn't work, you can create a new identity with your private key:

```bash
node create-identity.js
```

This will:
- Check your wallet balance
- Create a new identity if you have funds
- Automatically update your `.env` with the new identity ID
- Then you can run `node register-contract-final.js`
