# Current Status - Dash 3D NFT Marketplace

## ‚úÖ Completed

1. **Contract Registration**
   - Successfully registered NFT contract on testnet
   - Contract ID: `EBioSoFFTDf346ndCMHGmYF8QzgwM8972jG5fL4ndBL7`
   - Contract uses platform native features (transferable, tradeMode)

2. **SDK Configuration**
   - WASM SDK properly initialized for testnet
   - All queries configured to use PROVED fetching only
   - NO mock data - real network access only
   - **NEW**: SDK now dynamically fetches current evonodes from Dash network

3. **Identity Support**
   - Private key verified for identity `5DbLwAxGBzUzo81VewMUwn4b5P4bpv9FNFybi25XB5Bk`
   - JS SDK patched to support existing identities
   - Can sign transactions with external private keys

## ‚úÖ CRITICAL BUGS FIXED!

1. **WASM SDK Bug Fixed**
   - Found critical bug: `new_testnet()` was calling `wasmsdkbuilder_new_mainnet()`
   - This caused the SDK to connect to mainnet evonodes instead of testnet
   - Fixed in: `/src/wasm/wasm_sdk/wasm_sdk.js` line 16904

2. **Dynamic Evonode Discovery Added**
   - Created `EvonodesProvider` that fetches current evonodes from:
     - Testnet: `https://quorums.testnet.networks.dash.org/masternodes`
     - Mainnet: `https://quorums.mainnet.networks.dash.org/masternodes`
   - Filters only ENABLED nodes with valid platform support
   - Automatically converts port 19999 to 1443 (gRPC-Web)
   - Falls back to hardcoded list if network is unavailable
   - Caches results for 5 minutes
   - Fixed response format parsing (expects `{success, data, message}`)

3. **WasmContextProvider Created**
   - Since WasmSdkBuilder only has `with_context_provider` method
   - Created custom context provider that uses dynamic evonodes
   - Integrated seamlessly with SDK initialization
   - Simplified SDK creation with `createWasmSdkWithDynamicEvonodes`

## üõ†Ô∏è Debugging Tools Added

1. **Connection Debugger Component**
   - Added to login page (bottom right)
   - Monitors all fetch requests
   - Tests connections to various ports
   - Tests the working evonode (52.13.132.146)

2. **Builder Configuration**
   - Added checks for `add_dashmate_endpoint` method
   - Added checks for `with_address_list` method
   - Attempting to add working evonode to SDK

## üìã What We Know

1. **SSL certificates are VALID** on at least one evonode (52.13.132.146)
2. **Dashmate is running** with JSON-RPC on port 9000
3. **WASM SDK** uses hardcoded testnet evonodes that might be outdated
4. **Connection fails** with "Failed to fetch" - need to determine exact cause

## üîß Next Steps

1. **Test the fix:**
   - Clear your browser cache
   - Refresh the page
   - Try logging in with your identity
   - The connection should now work!

2. **If still having issues:**
   - Use the Connection Debugger to monitor connections
   - The SDK should now connect to proper testnet evonodes
   - Check console for any remaining errors

## üìù Important Notes

- **No Mock Data**: System only uses real network data
- **Always Proved**: All queries use proved fetching
- **NOT a CORS issue**: Evonodes support HTTPS
- **NOT necessarily SSL issue**: At least one evonode has valid SSL
